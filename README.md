*The Apocalypse is upon us, and it will get our feet wet.*

A real-time puzzle game, in which your goal is to save certain areas of the city from the endless flood by placing wall to wall barricades on the streets.

You have to collect at least **30 points to unlock the next level**!

Good bye, Mr. Sun!

You have to keep your positive attitude, even on the brink of Apocalypse! So let's get this party flooded!

Text, and scenery dancing and bouncing to the music. Click me jokes, easter eggs. Level selection map of Mouse Island.

Bonus stages:
* 5 + 1 Raining Man (catch the falling men)
* 10 + 1 Raining Cats and Dogs (catch the falling dogs, not the cats)

Level phases:
* Establish an HQ. Two sandbag carrier mice will appear there immediately.
* Pick up waving sandbag carrier townsmice randomly appearing on the streets with a truck and take them to the HQ. But be quick, because they only wait for a random amount of time before they run to the HQ by foot and leave everything behind. The more you pick up, the more sandbag you can place later. This stage is getting introduces in Level 2.
* Place the sandbags around the HQ before the flood reaches it. The further you place them, the more time it takes for the mice to take them there.
* Save all the left behind waving and jumping mice from the top of the buildings with a heli by clicking on the building rapidly a few dozen times and take them to the HQ before the buildings are crumbling down. When the water reaches the building it changes to scuba gear, than waits a random amount of time constantly losing bricks before diving in the depths. In this case all the mice left behind base jump to the deep and swim sadly to the safety. This stage is getting introduces in Level 3.

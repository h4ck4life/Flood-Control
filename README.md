# Flood Control

*The Apocalypse is upon us, and it will get our feet wet.*

A real-time puzzle game, in which your goal is to save certain areas from the endless flood with your mighty bulldozer pushing flood barriers to the right places.

You have 1 minute to make a completely sealed down area that cannot be reached by the flooding water after the time is up.

You will get:
* 10 points for every dry street
* 1 point for every unused second after the last barrier is in place

The bulldozer have to be inside the sealed down area and survive to unlock the next level.

You have to prove your skills through several levels with increasing number of barriers scattered accross the city.

Be quick, be efficient, and control the flood!

# Flood Control
Good bye, Mr. Sun!

You have to keep your positive attitude, even on the brink of Apocalypse! So let's get this party flooded!

Text, and scenery dancing and bouncing to the music. Click me jokes, easter eggs. Level selection map of Mouse Island.
Bonus stages:
* 5 + 1 Raining Man (catch the falling men)
* 10 + 1 Raining Cats and Dogs (catch the falling dogs, not the cats)
Level phases:
* Establish an HQ
* Grab waving sandbag carrier townsmice randomly appearing on the streets with a truck and take them to the HQ.
* Place the sandbags around the HQ before the flood reaches it.
* Save all the left behind waving and jumping mice from the top of the buildings with a heli by clicking on the building rapidly a few dozen times and take them to the HQ before the buildings are crumbling down. When the water reaches the building it changes to scuba gear, than waits a random amount of time constantly losing bricks before diving in the depths. In this case all the mice left behind base jump to the deep and swim sadly to the safety.
